            <h1>3. Bug reports</h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead">
				Please open a <strong><a class="body" href="https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff/issues">GitHub issue</a>
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">
				<b>Important:</b> In order to assess and fix the issue, I must be able to reproduce exactly the error condition. 
									This means that I need the following information:
				</p>
				<table class="table table-striped">
					<tr> <th> Item </th><th> Explanation </th><th> Example </th> </tr>
					<tr> <td>What?</td><td> A clear explanation of the bug condition.<br>Please copy the full stack trace if one is available.</td><td> "a RuntimeException occurss when trying to annotate..." </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td>How?</td><td> A minimal bug-demonstrating test case </td><td> "when running the following command/s...".<br> Make sure you send the exact command lines you are using. </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td>Which?</td><td> Which organism and genome version you are using (if applicable) </td><td> "we use GRCh37.72" </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td>Version</td><td> Which SnpEFf version and sub-version you are using?<br> Make sure to try the <b>latest version</b> since the bug might be already fixed. </td><td> "we are using SnpEFf 3.3H").<br> Hint: Running <code>java -jar snpEff.jar</code> shows version information. </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td>Command line</td><td> The full command line that shows the issue. </td><td> <code>java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar GRCh37.75 sample.vcf ...</code> </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td>Data</td><td> Sample data enough to reproduce the conditions<br><b>Always attach the data files</b> such as VCF lines (even if you added some snippets in the email's body)  </td><td> "find attached a sample of the VCF file..." </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td>Results</td><td> What you expect to obtain (if applicable)</td><td> "we expected result X, but we obtained Y instead..." </td> </tr>
				</table>
				</p>
				<br>
				<b>Important tips:</b> 
				<ul>
					<li> Make sure you <b>attached</b> a minimal dataset to reproduce the error condition. 
							For instance, a few VCF lines showing the problem are enough (sometimes one VCF line is enough), I don't need your full VCF file.

					<li> Always send the data <b>attached</b>, even if it's only one VCF line. There are two reasons for this: 
						i) many times the problem is a malformed line, which I can only asses if the data is attached, and 
						ii) I receive many emails, so reformatting copied &amp; pasted lines is a waste of time.

					<li> If you have to send large files, as sometimes happens with genome references, try uploading them to a server (e.g. Google Drive) and sending me a link. 
						Also remember to compress them.

					<li> <b>Try SnpEff's latest version. </b>
							SnpEff is updated often, may be the bug has already been corrected (e.g you are using version 3.1A, but I've already fixed it in version 3.1B).

				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">
				<b>Important:</b> In order to assess and your problem precisely, I must be able to reproduce your example.
									A request for help should include at least the following items:
				</p>
				<table class="table table-striped">
					<tr> <th> Item </th><th> Explanation </th><th> Example </th> </tr>
					<tr> <td>What?</td><td> A clear explanation of what you are trying to achieve </td><td> "I want to annotate variants... and then filter them to obtain..." </td> </tr>

				</table>
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
				<b>Note:</b> A few guidelines when asking for help...
				<ul>
					<li> <b>Use the latest version.</b> SnpEff is updated often, may be the issue has already been corrected (e.g you are using version 3.1A, but I've already fixed it in version 3.1B). 

					<li> <b>Read the documentation first.</b> Please make sure you've read the documentation before asking fo help. 
							I know this is obvious, but a lot of people ask for questions in that are answered or shown as examples in the documentation.

					<li> <b>If the documentation did not help.</b> I'm aware that the documentation is not always "easy reading" and I'm not Shakespeare. 
							So let me know which part of the manual is cofusing, outdated or plain wrong.
							I'm always trying to update and improve the docs.

					<li> <b>Be polite.</b> Again, it may be obvious, but you cannot imagine the number of emails I get saying something like 
							<blockquote><i> "I'm doing [something very wrong] and it doesn't work, so it' your fault because your program must have a bug!" </i></blockquote>
							or sometimes
							<blockquote><i>"You must drop everything you are doing and do my job for me right now!" </i></blockquote>

					<li> <b> Sometimes I'm too busy.</b> I always try to help people, but sometimes I'm too busy and I won't be able to answer your emails in due time and manner.
							Apologies in advanced.<br>

					<li> <b>If I don't get back to you...</b> Do remind me if I don't get back to you within a few days. 
							Sometimes I'm swamped with work or just out of town, a polite reminder helps.
							Keep in mind that this is not an invitation for you to spam me every single day because I didn't have time to answer your first email.

					<li> <b> Ask for too much advice.</b> I don’t mind helping, I’ve been doing it forever.
							However I won't be able to help you with all the details (due to limited time), so most times, the best I can do is to provide some pointers and general advise.

        <!-- features
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="features">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>5. Asking for new features </h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead">
				I always take into acoount features request.
				So don't hesitate to send me your ideas.<br>
				Please open a <strong><a class="body" href="https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff/issues">GitHub issue</a>
				</p>
				Of course, it  doesn't mean I'll get all suggestions implemented as soon as the issue is opened.
				But if a lot of people are asking for the same feature, it is a strong indicator that I should try to implement it sooner rather than later.
				<p>
				Please, don't be frustrated if I tell you I cannot implement your suggestion / idea. Keep in mind that some features are impossible to implement for different reasons, e.g.:
				<ul>
					<li> SnpEff uses some standard (e.g. VCF) and new features cannot break those standards.
					<li> SnpEff is used by a LOT of people in MANY diferent pipelines. New features must be compatible with current infrastructure and cannot break operational production pipelines.
					<li> Some feature requests are just too difficult to implement
				</ul>

        <!-- genome
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="genome">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>5. Asking for new database / genome </h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead">
				I'm willing to help you out if you need to build a new database (a.k.a. add a new reference genome).<br>
				Please open a <strong><a class="body" href="https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff/issues">GitHub issue</a>
				</p>
				<br>
				Building a new database (i.e. adding a new reference genome) is relatively easy and the procedure is descrived in detail <a href="http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html#databases"> in the documentetion </a>.
				If you are unable to build the database, I can try to help you out.
				In order to do so, I need you to send me the following information:
				<ul>
					<li> Name of the species
					<li> Reference genome version
					<li> A link to the reference genome sequence (i.e. a link to the FASTA file)
					<li> A link to a gene and transcript definition file (either GTF, GFF, GenBank, etc.)
					<li> At least one of the following (preferably, both):
						<ul>
							<li> A link to the CDS sequences (FASTA file)
							<li> A link to the protein sequences (FASTA files)
						</ul>
					<li> Codon table information (take a look a the codon tables in <code>snpEff.config</code> file):
						<ul>
							<li> Which codon table does the organism use? (e.g. <code>codon.Standard</code> or <code>codon.Mycoplasma</code>).
							<li> Specific codon tables used by some chromosomes (e.g. chromosome <code>'MT'</code> uses <code>codon.Vertebrate_Mitochondrial</code> table)
						</ul>
				</ul>
	
				<br> 
				I'm well aware that I could try to google that information myself, but I need you to send the information because I want to be absolutely sure we are using exactly the reference genome verison, sub-version, and data files you need.
